# haskell-shakki
A chess game made with Haskell as a exercise project for functional programming course

## How to run
You need to have stack installed - when in this directory, just run stack repl and after everything's loaded, type "shakki". A bit of a baling-twine&plywood solution, I know.

## What to know
The game relies on so called "gentlemen" rules, for example there's no handling for en passant and such. As a fix of sorts, players can freely move the pieces across the board from a menu.
